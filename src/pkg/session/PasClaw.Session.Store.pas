  PasClaw.Session.Store -- durable conversation sessions.

  Today `pasclaw agent` keeps its message history in process memory; a
  Ctrl-C / `/quit` / crash drops the whole conversation. Openclaw's
  /new / /reset / resume commands and nanobot's durable sessions
  treat each conversation as a persistent object you can come back to.

  Storage layout: one JSON file per session under
  $PASCLAW_HOME/workspace/sessions/<id>.json. The JSON carries
  everything RunToolLoop needs to continue the conversation --
  message history (user / assistant / tool with their tool_call
  pairings preserved), the compacted SystemPrompt override that
  PasClaw.Agent.Compact emits, the last provider/model the
  conversation ran against, an embedder-visible title, and
  created/updated timestamps for listing.

  ID shape: timestamp-prefix + 8 random hex chars (e.g.
  "20260601T134215-a3f4c2e1"). Sorts chronologically; readable by
  humans; collision-safe enough for a personal-agent home directory.

  Usage from Cmd.Agent.RunInteractive:

      Session := TSession.Create(A.Session);   { '' → new id }
      if Session.MetaExists then
        Session.Load(Session.Meta.Id)
      else
        Session.Save;                          { commit metadata }
      ... feed Session.Messages to the loop ...
      Session.Messages := Loop.FinalMessages;
      Session.Meta.SystemPromptOverride := Loop.FinalSystemPrompt;
      Session.Touch;
      Session.Save;

  Other call sites (cmd session list / show / delete, the gateway's
  read-only /v1/sessions endpoint) use ListSessions / SessionPath /
  DeleteSession without instantiating the class.

   Pruning DELETES from the session file: the loop's history is what

   every export of it. That is correct for the live file -- it is the
   resume state, and a resume that replayed the pruned messages would
   undo the prune -- but it means a context-management decision silently
   costs the record of what happened.

   So the transcript is copied ONCE, the first time a session is
   pruned, to <id>.orig.json beside it. Once: the point is the original,
   and a copy taken on the second prune would already be missing what
   the first one removed. Nothing reads it during a run; it exists for
   `session export --full` and for anyone going back to ask what the
   agent actually saw. *)

   on) and when there was nothing to copy. Never raises: failing to
   archive must not fail the turn. *)
(* ---- the append-only transcript log ----

   Compaction is not pruning, but it costs the same thing. The tool
   loop replaces the older half of a conversation with a summary so the
   next turn fits; every surface writes the loop's result back as the
   session; and the turns that were summarised are gone -- from disk,
   from a browser reload, from `session export`. Measured on the
   desktop: one ordinary turn on a long chat took a session from 1602
   stored messages to 117, and the opening of the conversation went
   with it.

   That is right for the LIVE file. It is the resume state, and a
   resume that replayed the summarised turns would undo the
   compaction. It is wrong for the record.

   So every message is written once, as it happens, to
   <id>.log.jsonl beside the session: one JSON object per line,
   appended, never rewritten. The live file stays the model's working
   context; the log is what the conversation WAS. Reading is windowed
   (see ReadSessionLog) because the whole point is that it grows
   without bound.

   JSON Lines rather than a JSON array so appending is a file append
   and not a read-modify-write of the whole history -- this happens on
   every turn, and at 2 MB of transcript the rewrite is the expensive
   part. *)

(* One lock per session id, for callers that run a whole TURN against

   other's -- the classic lost update, reachable from the desktop by
   submitting in two tabs at once. Different sessions get different
   locks and never wait on each other.

(* The messages an EXPORT should carry: the record when one exists,

   For a compacted session the record is the only complete transcript

   silently omits every turn compaction removed while the record sits
   beside it holding them. Pre-log sessions have no record, and their

   yields the same state. Callers invoke this after a successful

   arguing with the live one. Every other role, tool calls and tool
