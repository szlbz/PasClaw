  PasClaw.Gateway.Server - HTTP gateway built on TIdHTTPServer.
  Hosts a small JSON API:

    GET  /v1/status                -> provider, model, tools, mcp_servers, ...
    GET  /v1/tools                 -> registered tool descriptors
    POST /v1/chat                  -> body has "message", reply has "content"

                                       -- SSE if stream:true is set)
    POST /v1/responses             -> OpenAI Responses-compatible
                                      (request: {model, input, ...},

                                      at POST /v1/mcp/rpc so version-
                                      prefixed deployments stay greppable.
    GET  /v1/models                -> OpenAI-compatible model list
    GET  /v1/version               -> build version

  Mirrors a stripped-down pkg/gateway from picoclaw. The `serve` subcommand
  is a focused wrapper for the OpenAI-compatible surface; `gateway` is the
  full feature set with channels.

       of that setting -- so taking the name alone and sending it to the
       primary asks Anthropic for a Llama and gets a non-retryable 404.

       rather than on a per-run object because the answer -- "has the
       operator paused the agent system?" -- is the same for every run.

       This is what makes `pasclaw team pause` (and the desktop's Pause
       all) an actual stop rather than a request. The wind-down note in
       SetAgentsPaused still goes out and is still the nicer outcome --
       an agent that reads it writes down where it got to before it
       stops -- but a turn that never calls another tool would never
       read it, and that is exactly the runaway an operator hits pause
       for. Every turn now ends at its next boundary whether the model
       cooperates or not.

       Reads paused.json each time it is asked, which sounds wasteful
       and is not: boundaries are one per loop iteration and an
       iteration costs a provider round trip. Reading it fresh is also
       the point -- a flag cached at turn start would be the same flag
       that was False when the turn began. A torn read while the file
       is being rewritten parses as nothing and answers False, so the

  (* Working-state flush for gateway compactions.

     For a passthrough caller the gateway's transcript IS its memory:
     the request carries the full message history, so a snapshot adds
     nothing while the transcript still exists. Compaction is the one
     moment that stops being true. The older half is about to leave the
     transcript for good, and a CLI `pasclaw resume <id>` of this same
     session -- the store is shared across surfaces -- would find
     neither the messages nor the snapshot the CLI expects to inject.

     (A session_context turn is the other case, and it needs the
     snapshot even harder: there the server owns the transcript, so a
     compaction drops context no client can send again.
     PersistGatewaySession refreshes the snapshot every turn for those,
     and HandleChatCompletions reads it back into the prompt. This hook
     stays because it fires at the exact moment of the drop, with the
     pre-drop history in hand -- which is the one view neither of those
     has.)

     So: flush exactly once, at drop time, with the full pre-drop
     history. CompactOpts.OnBefore is `of object` and carries no
     session id, hence this one-field object; RunCheckpointedLoop
     creates it per run (it has both the id and a local config copy)
     and frees it after. Load-update-save keeps no session object
     alive across the call, and the stats lock serializes it against
     the accumulator's own load-save of the same file. *)

(* One bucket per (endpoint, provider, model), not per endpoint.

   Meta.Model and Meta.Provider are scalar and get overwritten on every
   request, so a single per-endpoint bucket attributed its ENTIRE
   cumulative token total to whichever request landed last. With 100
   requests on one model followed by one request on another, the
   /v1/stats by_model table credited all 150,015 tokens to the model
   that used 15, and the model that did the work vanished from the
   table completely. Totals were always right; only the breakdown was
   wrong -- which is the half the web UI renders as a per-model table
   with no caveat, and its model picker makes switching models the
   normal case.

   Scoping the id by the fields being reported makes those scalars true
   by construction: every request in a bucket shares its provider and
   model, so overwriting them is a no-op rather than a lie. No schema
   change -- this is option (a) named in AccumulateGatewayStats below.

   PROVIDER, not just model. Keying on model alone left by_provider
   with the identical defect: /v1/config can switch the primary
   provider while clients keep sending the same model string, and two
   providers commonly serve one name (a direct vendor key and an
   aggregator both answering "claude-opus-4-7"). Those shared a bucket,
   and by_provider credited the first provider's tokens to the second.
   Codex P2 on PR #586 -- the same failure this function exists to fix,
   surviving in the other column.

   HASH SUFFIX, because the readable part is lossy. Sanitising maps
   every character outside [A-Za-z0-9_-] to '-', so "openai/gpt-5" and
   "openai:gpt-5" flatten to one string; trailing separators are
   stripped; and anything past MaxReadable is truncated, which collides
   any two long ids sharing a prefix -- entirely plausible for dated or
   versioned model names. A collision merges counters and reinstates
   the very misattribution being fixed, so the id carries a 32-bit
   FNV-1a of the RAW provider and model, separated by a byte that
   cannot occur in either. The readable prefix stays for humans reading
   the session list; the suffix is what makes the identity sound.

   Empty provider AND model falls back to the bare endpoint id: it

(* Persist a gateway turn as a REAL session when the request named one.

   The stats buckets (_gateway_v1_chat and friends) deliberately keep
   counters and no transcript -- they aggregate stateless passthrough, where
   the conversation belongs to the caller. But a request that carries
   X-PasClaw-Session (or an OpenAI `user` field we map to one) is not
   passthrough: the operator has named a durable conversation, and every
   other surface treats that as a session on disk.

   Without this the gateway was the only surface whose sessions never
   existed, which quietly disabled the whole failure-learning chain for it:
   `pasclaw learn` mines sessions, `--write-scars` turns recurring failures
   into SCARS.md, and SCARS.md feeds the prompt. Someone driving PasClaw
   through the web UI, the desktop app or the HTTP API got none of it, and
   the agent kept relearning mistakes it had already made there.

{ Per-endpoint stats bucket for stateless gateway requests. The

  at /v1/stats for those paths. Bucketing by endpoint folds every
  request through that endpoint into one synthetic session whose
  Turns / tokens / tool-calls counters accumulate across calls.

  Bucket granularity is (endpoint, model), via GatewayBucketId --
  option (a) of the two this comment used to weigh. It was
  aggregate-per-endpoint, and because Meta.Model / Meta.Provider are
  scalar and overwritten per request, that attributed a bucket's whole
  cumulative total to whichever model ran last: measured at 150,015
  tokens credited to a model that used 15, with the model that used
  150,000 absent from the table entirely. Totals were unaffected
  throughout; only the by_model / by_provider breakdown was wrong.
  Scoping the id by model makes the scalar field true by construction.

  Migration: buckets written before this change keep their old ids and
  their old (misattributed) history. Nothing reads them differently --
  HandleStats just walks the directory -- so old rows persist under the
  last model they saw, and new traffic accumulates correctly alongside.
  Operators who want a clean table delete the _gateway_* sessions.

  Thread safety: a global TCriticalSection (inside the Raw
  primitive below) serialises the open-accumulate-save sequence.
  Two concurrent calls to the same endpoint would otherwise race
  the file. Bucket granularity is fine for the contention we
  expect (operator driving one tab at a time); per-bucket locks

     standalone SDK's fetches carry none -- so gating these routes on that
     token is a contradiction: the only way to make them work would be to
     hand the untrusted origin the very credential the split protects.

(* Non-GET/non-POST verbs land here. Indy's TIdHTTPServer routes
   GET/POST/HEAD through OnCommandGet and everything else (PUT,
   DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH, ...) through OnCommandOther. When this
   handler was unassigned (the historical state), Indy fell back to
   firing OnCommandGet for those verbs too -- which is how the
   existing PUT /v1/config, DELETE /v1/skills/*, and the
   /v1/sessions/* PUT/DELETE handlers in the OnCommandGet dispatch
   block ever ran.

   Wiring this handler for the OPTIONS preflight case (Codex P2 on
   PR #324) broke that fallback -- PUT and DELETE traffic started
   getting a 405 instead of reaching their handlers, killing
   settings save / session delete / skill remove from the web UI.
   Codex P1 review on PR #327.

   Fix: handle OPTIONS preflights for /v1/relay/* here (they MUST
   NOT carry credentials per the CORS spec, so they go BEFORE the
   bearer-token gate) and delegate everything else to OnCommandGet
   so the existing dispatch block runs. The catch-all 404 inside
   OnCommandGet's dispatch handles truly-unknown verb+path pairs. *)

  The canonical zip carries a top-level "workspace/" dir (what our export

  workspace/ -- that would nest workspace/workspace/. Instead we extract
  to a staging dir at the home root, then merge ONLY staging/workspace ->
  home/workspace. Two payoffs:
    * A full `pasclaw build` zip (which also has sessions/, config.json,

      so a stray config.json in the upload can NEVER overwrite the running
      server's secrets.
    * A "bare" zip (files at the root, no workspace/ dir) still works: we
      fall back to merging the whole staging tree.
  ExtractZipToDir zip-slip-validates every entry before writing, and the
  staging dir is deleted regardless of outcome. }

   carrying tool_calls. Storing the array unchanged passes the store's

   Windows resolves aliases through REPARSE POINTS -- directory

   and TFileStream would then happily follow the reparse point and
   serve the secret. That is the same bypass PR #280 closed on Unix;
   the canonicalisation was simply never written for Windows, so BOTH
   the config-file check and the OAuth directory check inherited the
   hole.

   GetFinalPathNameByHandleW resolves the whole chain. The handle is
   opened with dwDesiredAccess = 0 (query only, no read rights needed)
   and FILE_FLAG_BACKUP_SEMANTICS, which is what permits opening a
   DIRECTORY handle at all -- without it the oauth-directory case fails
   and silently degrades to the lexical compare.

   The import is PasClaw-prefixed rather than named after the API:
   recent Winapi.Windows declares GetFinalPathNameByHandleW itself, and
   an identically-named local declaration would shadow it silently. A
   distinct name means the two can never be confused for one another,
   and older FPC Windows headers that lack it are still covered.

   NOT COMPILE-TESTED: this container has no Windows target or cross

     GET /v1/fs/read?path=$PASCLAW_HOME/oauth/github.json returned the

     token is configured, that made third-party refresh tokens readable

       When the sandbox is on, default to its configured workspace
       so the operator's first request returns useful contents
       (the listing of /v1/fs/workspace) instead of an immediate
       403 on $PASCLAW_HOME root. When the sandbox is off (or no
       workspace is configured), keep the historical $PASCLAW_HOME
       fallback so single-user CLI / desktop deployments still
       browse the config tree from the home root.

       Side-stepping the 403 silently is the right call here --
       /v1/fs is operator-facing, not the model's tool surface
       (that's tools/fs_read), and an empty-path "give me
       something" request really does want the directory the
       sandbox WILL allow rather than one it's guaranteed to
       refuse.

       Prefer the PasClaw workspace ($PASCLAW_HOME/workspace -- where
       memory, skills and generated files live) over CurrentWorkspace.
       The sandbox "workspace" defaults to the process launch directory
       (GetCurrentDir) when none is configured, so an operator browsing
       Files in the web UI was landing on wherever the binary booted
       instead of the agent's workspace.

       Adopt it only when it exists AND the policy permits reading it:
         - Default config (restrict_to_workspace=false): CanReadPath
           short-circuits to True, so the browser lands on the workspace
           -- the common Docker/web-only boot the user reported.
         - restrict_to_workspace=true with no configured workspace
           (GWorkspace defaulted to cwd): the agent workspace is OUTSIDE
           the sandbox, so the probe fails and we fall back to
           CurrentWorkspace. That is correct, not a regression -- a
           listing of $PASCLAW_HOME/workspace would be refused by the
           CanReadPath gate below anyway, so the allowed cwd is the only
           directory that won't 403. Operators who want the workspace

   Why this exists: Indy's WriteHeader emits both `Content-Length: 0`
   AND `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` for streaming responses (the
   ContentLength := -1 "suppress auto Content-Length" workaround
   doesn't actually suppress -- it leaves CL=0 in place because
   Indy treats negative values as "fall through to ContentText length"
   which is empty). That combination is a HTTP/1.1 protocol violation
   per RFC 7230 §3.3.3 -- strict L7 proxies (DigitalOcean App
   Platform's Envoy frontend, AWS ALB in strict mode, Cloudflare
   Workers) reject it with `upstream_reset_before_response_started
   {protocol_error}` and never forward the response body. Loose
   proxies (nginx default, local curl) tolerate it, which is why
   the bug only shows up on managed platforms.

   Indy ALSO rewrites our `text/event-stream` ContentType back to
   `text/html; charset=utf-8` under conditions that are hard to
   override from outside the unit (around the Content-Length /
   Transfer-Encoding interaction). Bypassing WriteHeader fixes
   that too -- the literal bytes in HeaderStr are what reach the
   wire verbatim.

   This is the same workaround HandleLogs has been using since the
   `/v1/logs` SSE feed shipped; centralising it into a helper means
   the same fix applies to /v1/chat/completions and /v1/responses
   without duplicating the byte-twiddle.

       and O(n) back for each message, and the compaction the loop did
       was thrown away because the client kept resending the long copy.

       With session_context the client sends only what is NEW. The stored
       turns are loaded here and the request's messages are appended to
       them, so the model sees the whole conversation without the browser
       having to hold or ship it.

       Opt-in, and only alongside a session id, because /v1/chat/

{ ============= provider-signature cache (Gemini 3 thoughtSignature) =============

  PR #154 added a `provider_signature` extension field on /v1/responses
  function_call output items so PasClaw could round-trip Gemini 3+'s
  thoughtSignature across turns. That works for a PasClaw-aware client.
  Codex CLI (and any stock OpenAI-Responses client) JSON-validates input
  items and drops unknown fields -- so the signature is gone by the next
  turn, and Gemini 3 returns:

      400 Function call is missing a thought_signature in functionCall parts.

  Belt-and-suspenders: also keep a process-wide call_id -> signature map.
  Whenever PasClaw emits a function_call output item with a non-empty
  signature, remember it. When an incoming function_call input item lacks
  one but echoes a call_id we recognise, restore it before the request
  goes back to the provider.

  Bounded to PROVIDER_SIGNATURE_CACHE_MAX entries (default 1024) -- a
  long-lived /v1/responses session has maybe dozens of tool calls; 1024
  covers ~50 active conversations comfortably. Eviction is FIFO via
  TStringList ordering; we delete the oldest when capacity hits.
  Per-process, in-memory only -- restart drops the cache (consistent
  with the rest of /v1/responses, which has no durable session). }

  PROVIDER_SIGNATURE_CACHE_MAX = 1024;

      `gemini_call_<name>_<index>` when the original assistant
      turn didn't carry one (PasClaw.Providers.Gemini), so two
      conversations that both call the same tool first end up
      with identical call_ids. Early-exiting would keep the
      FIRST conversation's signature forever and serve it back
      to the SECOND conversation -- the next turn there replays
      a stale thought_signature and Gemini rejects it.

      Delete-then-Add (vs. updating in place via Values[]) is
      deliberate: it ALSO refreshes the FIFO eviction position,
      so a tool call that just got reused isn't the next to be

    id      - opaque item id, "fc_<random>". Identifies the item
              within the response.
    call_id - "call_<random>". The handle the client uses to match
              its function_call_output back to this call on the
              next turn.

  Many implementations use the same value for both; we use distinct
  prefixes so logs can tell them apart. status is "completed" once
  the arguments are fully serialized.

  The arguments field is a *string* (raw JSON), not a JSON object.
  That matches OpenAI's schema and means a model that emits args
  with escaped quotes round-trips correctly.

  Signature: provider-specific opaque blob the gateway must echo
  back on the next turn (Gemini 3+'s thoughtSignature). Emitted as a
  custom "provider_signature" extension; the OpenAI Responses spec
  permits unknown fields, and PasClaw's own Codex client knows to
  echo this back on the function_call_output input item. Empty
  string -> field omitted so stock /v1/responses traffic stays clean.

   Event order (omitting text events when Content is empty, and
   adding one function_call sub-sequence per tool call):

     response.created                            { in_progress, empty output }
     response.in_progress
     [ message sub-sequence -- only if Content <> '' ]
       response.output_item.added                { message item }
       response.content_part.added               { output_text part }
       response.output_text.delta                { full text, one delta }
       response.output_text.done
       response.content_part.done
       response.output_item.done                 { message item completed }
     [ for each tool call -- Phase 2 tool passthrough ]
       response.output_item.added                { function_call item, args="" }
       response.function_call_arguments.delta    { full args, one delta }
       response.function_call_arguments.done
       response.output_item.done                 { function_call item completed }
     response.completed                          { full output, usage }

   output_index increases per item; message (when present) is 0
   and function_calls follow. Each function_call gets a unique
   fc_<...> item id; call_id is the model's TToolCall.Id which
   the client uses to match its function_call_output back on the
   next turn.

   Single-delta caveat from Phase A still applies: text and args
   come out as one chunk each because the tool loop / single-shot
   provider call here is synchronous. Real partial streaming will
   land in a follow-up that hooks the provider's OnChunk
   callback. *)

  { Codex (and any Responses-API client doing multi-turn tool use)
    sends previous-turn function_call items as separate input items
    with no parent message. The Chat-Completions-style providers we
    use expect each assistant turn to carry an embedded tool_calls
    array. When the client emits parallel calls in one turn (multiple
    consecutive function_call items before any function_call_output),
    coalesce them into a single assistant message so the request
    body keeps the original turn boundaries: Anthropic in particular
    rejects request shapes where a tool_use block appears in a turn
    whose preceding turn already produced tool_use blocks without
    intervening tool_result blocks. Matching with the corresponding
    function_call_output is still by call_id regardless of grouping.

    Signature: the provider_signature extension we emit when shipping
    function_call items downstream. Codex (or any PasClaw-aware
    client) echoes it back on the input function_call item so this
    side can stuff it back onto the TToolCall -- required for Gemini
    3+ thoughtSignature round-trips through /v1/responses. Codex P1

                   extension echoed it back).
                2. Server-side cache by call_id (the stock-client path
                   -- Codex CLI etc. strip unknown fields, so we
                   restore from memory).
              Either path yields a non-empty signature when the original
              tool call carried one, so Gemini 3's "missing
